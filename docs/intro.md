import BibRef from '@site/src/components/BibRef';

This site is currently comprised largely of my personal lecture notes stemming from Francis Su's [real analysis lecture series](https://analysisyawp.blogspot.com/) on YouTube, lectures he graciously made available from a class he taught at Harvey Mudd College in Spring 2010.

The text for the course was based on Walter Rudin's classic *Principles of Mathematical Analysis* <BibRef id='WR1976' pages=''></BibRef>. 

The goal of this site is to expand beyond the notes take from Su's lectures and become something more dynamic through the magic of open source contributions and the like. More details will be coming soon to clarify the vision in greater detail, but some may find great use in the lecture notes already provided.
